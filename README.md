# AI Impact on Jobs by 2030

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a distant idea. It is already changing how work is done, which skills are important, and which jobs are most at risk of automation. With news reports frequently talking about job lay-offs, some are caused by economic problems, while others are linked to the growing use of AI and automation. This project explores these changes using the AI Impact on Jobs 2030 dataset.

The aim of this analysis is not to predict exactly how many jobs will be lost or created. Instead, it focuses on understanding patterns in AI exposure, automation risk, and how job skills may change across different occupations. By using realistic job roles, salaries, skill levels, and automation probabilities, this dataset helps us explore important questions about the future of work in a safe and ethical way.


## Dataset Content
I’m using the AI Impact on Jobs dataset from Kaggle. It includes different jobs, the skills and education they require, and how likely they are to be automated by 2030. The dataset combines information from sources like O*NET, McKinsey, the World Economic Forum, and LinkedIn/Glassdoor, with all numbers simulated to make the data realistic. Jobs are grouped into High, Medium, or Low automation risk, and skill levels are shown across ten areas. Using this dataset helps me explore which jobs might be most affected by automation and why. It is safe to use because it contains no personal data and complies with data privacy regulations.

## Business Requirements
1. Clean and Transform Data:
Prepare the raw dataset by handling missing values, standardising formats, and structuring it for analysis and visualisation.
2. Classify Job Risk Levels:
Identify high-, medium-, and low-risk jobs for AI-driven automation based on risk scores.
3. Analyse Relationships:
Explore how education levels and skills affect automation risk to understand why some jobs are safer while others are more vulnerable.
4. Visualise Insights:
Build clear visual summaries (charts, graphs, dashboards) to highlight key findings for decision-making.
5. Ensure Compliance:
Verify that all data handling aligns with regulations such as GDPR to protect personal or sensitive information.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* As of December 2025 in the UK, unemployment is rising, particularly among recent graduates. Hypothesis is jobs requiring routine or manual skills are expected to be at higher risk of AI-driven automation by 2030.
To valididate this hypothesis:
1. Analyse Automation Risk Scores: Examine the dataset to determine risk scores assigned to different job categories.
2. Compare Job Types: Separate jobs into routine/manual versus cognitive/creative, and compare their automation risk levels.
3. Visualise Patterns: Use bar charts, heatmaps, or scatter plots to highlight differences in risk across job types and support the hypothesis with visual evidence.

Project Hypotheses

1. Hypothesis 1:

Jobs requiring routine or manual skills are at higher risk of AI-driven automation by 2030.

Validation:

Analyze automation risk scores across job categories.

Compare risk levels for jobs classified as routine/manual versus cognitive/creative.

Use visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps) to confirm patterns.

2. Hypothesis 2:

Higher education levels correlate with lower automation risk.

Validation:

Group jobs by education level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).

Calculate average automation risk for each group.

Use scatter plots or boxplots to visualize correlations.

3. Hypothesis 3:

Jobs requiring advanced digital or cognitive skills are less vulnerable to AI automation.

Validation:

Identify skills associated with each job in the dataset.

Compute correlations between skill types and automation risk.

Highlight trends in visual summaries or dashboards.

4. Hypothesis 4 (Optional/Exploratory):

Certain sectors (e.g., healthcare, IT) will have lower overall automation risk compared to manufacturing or clerical jobs.

Validation:

Aggregate jobs by sector and calculate mean risk scores.

Visualize sector-wise risk comparisons using bar charts or heatmaps.

## Project Plan
$\color{red}{\text{To be continued}}$
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?


## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
